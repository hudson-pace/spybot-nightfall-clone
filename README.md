# Spybot: The Nightfall Incident
## Description
A clone of LEGO's Spybot: The Nightfall Incident, one of my favorite flash game from my youth. It features assets ~~stolen~~ borrowed from the original. Once all of the original features are implemented, new ones may follow.

## Planned Features

### Missing Features From the Original
As it stands, this project is approaching a facsimile of the original. Notable missing features include:

- The ability to save progress.
- Dialogue and story.
- Zones with security levels.

### Level Editor

This project includes a basic level editor for battles (https://hudson-pace.github.io/spybot-nightfall-clone/level-editor, or use the link in the main game). More features will be added, including:
- Editing existing battles.
- Creating entire maps, with nodes, battles, and connections.

It also needs some work to make it look less ugly.

### Misc
- I need to sort out my messy UI and improve the artwork.
- The AI has a lot of room for improvement. As it stands, it's just functional enough to test gameplay.

## Setup
No fancy setup is required. For the latest version, just clone the repo and start a web server in the root directory and you're golden. Alternatively, check it out at https://hudson-pace.github.io/spybot-nightfall-clone.
