# Spybot: The Nightfall Incident
## Description
---
A clone of LEGO's Spybot: The Nightfall Incident, one of my favorite flash game from my youth. It features assets ~~stolen~~ borrowed from the original. Once all of the original features are implemented, new ones may follow.


## Planned Features
---
As it stands, this project is approaching a facsimile of the original. Notable missing features include:

- Commands to heal, boost programs, and alter the terrain.
- Items on the map, e.g. credits and data.
- Battles whose objective is to obtain data.

And, less importantly:

- Dialogue and story.
- Zones with security levels.

I don't care much about those last two, but I'll probably implement them for the sake of creating an accurate clone.

Development on a level editor for battles is underway. Further down the road, there may be an editor for entire maps as well.

I need to sort out my messy UI and improve the artwork.

The AI has a lot of room for improvement. It is just functional enough to test gameplay.

## Setup
---
No fancy setup is required. For the latest version, just clone the repo and start a web server in the root directory and you're golden. Alternatively, check it out at https://hudson-pace.github.io/spybot-nightfall-clone.
