# Spybot: The Nightfall Incident
## Description
A clone of LEGO's Spybot: The Nightfall Incident, one of my favorite flash game from my youth. It features assets ~~stolen~~ borrowed from the original. Once all of the original features are implemented, new ones may follow.

## Planned Features

### Missing Features From the Original
As it stands, this project is approaching a facsimile of the original. Major missing features include:

- The ability to save progress.
- Music and sound effects.

### Map Editor

This project includes a map editor (https://hudson-pace.github.io/spybot-nightfall-clone/level-editor, or use the link in the main game). It's fully functional, but I would like to make it prettier and more user-friendly. It also needs to be more thoroughly tested, especially for cross-browser support.

### Misc
- I need to sort out my messy UI and improve the artwork.
- The AI has a lot of room for improvement. As it stands, it's just functional enough to test gameplay.

## Setup
No fancy setup is required. For the latest version, just clone the repo and start a web server in the root directory and you're golden. Alternatively, check it out at https://hudson-pace.github.io/spybot-nightfall-clone.
